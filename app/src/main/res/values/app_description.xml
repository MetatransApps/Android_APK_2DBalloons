Inspired by colorful balls, we created Ð° game for shooting these balls. The goal is to shoot them all and to go forward through the levels.
After each level the balls become a bit faster and theirs count is increasing.
This game can make you relax and spend some time.

The game is supporting different playing levels as well as more other features, like:
1. High scores - keeps track of your best result.
2. Supports different color palettes for different tastes.
3. Supports tablets and phones.
4. Increasing difficulties.

Your feedback and/or review is more than welcome.
