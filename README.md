Non Stop Balloons
-----------------

This is a pied shooting balloon game. The goal is to not allow all the coming motley Balloons to get into the center of the screen, where the crossbow is shooting with its arrows. When you crack up enough Balloons, you go to the next level. After each level the balloons become a bit faster, their overall count is increasing, and the space they are coming from is getting bigger. The game is especially designed for kids. We also believe the app could be very interesting for adults who like colorful games and action.

Features:
1. Increasing difficulty in levels.
2. 7 unique background themes - 1 fortress, 3 brick walls and 3 gradients.
3. High scores - keeps track of your best result.
4. Supports different color palettes for different tastes.
